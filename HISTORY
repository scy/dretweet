  ===================

- Added source parameter (so Twitter now shows "from dretweet" in the meta 
  information of our tweets).

- Added multi-user support by using multiple config files. Your previous 
  config file will not work, so please check out the provided example.conf and 
  the README to see how the new format and file naming scheme looks like.



  0.1  --  2009-01-22
  ===================

- First release. Single-user and pretty lame, but working.
