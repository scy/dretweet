   dretweet - Direct Message Retweet
   =================================

dretweet is a small tool to periodically retrieve direct messages sent to a 
Twitter[1] account. It will then send the messages on behalf of that account, 
letting it look like someone would have written the tweet while logged in to 
that account.

This is useful for Twitter accounts that belong to a group or project. Since 
only people that are being followed by an account can send it a direct 
message, no additional authentication is needed.

dretweet can be installed on any host that runs PHP 5 or higher. It is usually  
run via a cron job.

 - Get the source and unpack it somewhere. You can use "git clone 
   git://github.com/scy/dretweet.git" if you want, that'll simplify updating 
   later on.

 - Copy config.php.dist to config.php and edit it to your needs.

 - Make sure that dretweet.php gets called in regular intervals, for example 
   by a cronjob.


 F r e q u e n t l y   A s k e d   Q u e s t i o n s
 ---------------------------------------------------

 - What about multi-account support?

   Yes, I'd like to have that, too. Either you'll wait until I find the time 
   to implement it, or simply send me a patch.

 - So everybody who is followed by the account dretweet posts to has the right 
   to send new messages?

   Yep.

 - Could people send something like "LEAVE theoriginaladminsname" and take 
   control over everything?

   Yep. Trust the people, or don't follow them. Luckily, they cannot change 
   the account's password, so you can still lock them out when they start 
   doing nasty stuff.

 - Would it be possible to ADD FEATURE X?

   Most likely. However, my time is limited. You may ask for new features, but 
   be prepared for "sorry, I'm currently not interested in implementing this". 
   If you write the feature yourself and send a patch, the chance to have it 
   included is much higher. ;)
